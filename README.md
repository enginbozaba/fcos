# üîé  FCOS Pytorch

_A model implementing 2D object detection in images, trained on Cityscapes_

This is a pure Python 3.8 implementation of the fully convolutional one-stage anchor free FCOS algorithm.
It has been slightly adapted from the original paper [FCOS: Fully Convolutional One-Stage Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.01355.pdf).
This package will work with or without a cuda GPU. Without a GPU, you're going to be waiting a fair bit longer.

‚ö†Ô∏è  **Note** This is still just a toy implementation. You probably shouldn't try and use it for anything yet.

## Quickstart
From zero to training in under 2 minutes (assumes you have `pyenv` installed, with a working Python 3.8.1 available).

```
pyenv local 3.8.1
pip install virtualenv
python -m virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install git+https://github.com/rosshemsley/fcos
fcos train --cityscapes-dir <path/to/cityscapes> -v
```

## Installing with pip
You can **pip install this package directly** if your pip is recent enough (20.1 is known to work).

```
$ pip install git+https://github.com/rosshemsley/fcos
```

## Installing locally
It is recommended that you use `pyenv` to set up a local version of Python. From the project root, run

```
$ pyenv local 3.8
```

Poetry can be used to install the package and dependencies
```
$ poetry install
```

To run the unit tests, you can use
```
$ poetry run pytest tests
```

## Training
Once you have installed the package, you can use the bundled CLI to train and test the network.
The following commands assume you have activated the environment containing the installed package.

The following command may be used to train the network
```
$ fcos train \
    --cityscapes-dir <path/to/Cityscapes> \
    --verbose
```

To track status using tensorboard, you can run
```
$ tensorboard --logdir runs
```

Models are written to the same directory as the tensorboard logs for now, the default is at `runs/`.

### Evaluating on the test set
To test inference on the Cityscapes test set.

```
$ fcos test \
    --cityscapes-dir <path/to/Cityscapes> \
    --model-checkpoint <path/to/checkpoint.chkpt> \
    --output ./output 
```

This will write predicted bounding boxes to all of the images in the test set into the output directory.
